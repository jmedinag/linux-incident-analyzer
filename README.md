# Overview

**LIA (Linux Incident Analyzer)** is a lightweight diagnostic framework that helps engineers perform initial Linux incident analysis by collecting system evidence, evaluating health indicators, and providing operational recommendations.

LIA focuses on the first phase of incident response:

> Collect evidence → Analyze conditions → Recommend investigation steps


It helps investigate common Linux operational problems:

- High CPU usage
- Memory pressure
- Disk exhaustion
- Failed services
- Network issues
- System degradation


LIA is designed to support engineers during troubleshooting without automatically modifying the system.

# Key Features


## System Analysis

Automated analysis of critical Linux components:


| Component | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| CPU | Usage, load average, processes |
| Memory | RAM, swap, pressure indicators |
| Storage | Disk usage, filesystems, inodes |
| Processes | Resource consumption |
| Services | Failed systemd units |
| Network | Interface and connectivity status |


---

# Design Principles


## Evidence First

LIA collects information before recommending actions.


## Non-Invasive

No automatic remediation.
No configuration changes.
No destructive operations.


## Lightweight

Built using native Linux tools and Bash scripting.


## Knowledge Separation

Diagnostic logic is separated from operational knowledge, allowing continuous improvement without modifying the core engine.
